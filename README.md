# Internet Programming Final Project
This repository includes the files for my final project in my Internet Programming class.
This project was a mock movie buying website that allowed users to search for movies, add them to their cart, and "buy" them.
This project used the OMDB API in order to search for movies within the OMDB database.
It was created using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and PHP. 
Unfortunately, it does not have full functionality as I was not able to download the files that were included by my professor for the project. 
All of the code I wrote is there, though.
